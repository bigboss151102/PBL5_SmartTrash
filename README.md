# Description
## 1. Design and Build of Smart Trash Bins:
- We have designed and constructed smart trash bins that are compact and suitable for various public settings such as schools, parks, residential areas, and commercial zones.
- These bins are partitioned into multiple compartments to accommodate different types of waste, including paper, plastic, and metal.

## 2. Integration of Camera and Image Processing System:
- Each trash bin is equipped with an internal camera to capture images of deposited waste.
- The images are transmitted to a server for processing, facilitating real-time analysis of waste content.

## 3.AI Model Application for Waste Classification:
- Utilizing advanced AI technology, our server deploys models to analyze and categorize waste based on the images received from ESP32 cameras.
- This automated classification system enhances efficiency in waste management processes.

## 4. Mechanism for Compartment Rotation:
- Our smart bins feature a mechanical system that rotates compartments according to the waste type identified by the AI model.
- This ensures precise segregation and facilitates easier waste collection and recycling.

## 5. Management and Monitoring via Server System:
- A centralized server manages and monitors the status of each trash bin in real-time.
- It provides an intuitive interface for administrators to track fill levels, optimize collection routes, and promptly respond to bin capacity.
